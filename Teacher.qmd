# Using Integral as a teacher

Integral can be all you need to teach A level maths.

The true power of Integral comes from students having individual accounts but that means you need to be mindful of what they can access. This will be discussed in each option below.

Choose a scenario below to see how to use Integral to help with your teaching.

I want to:

-   Plan a lesson

-   Assess my students

-   Set homework

-   Learn about topics/modules I have not taught yet

-   Integrate Integral (ahem) into my scheme of work
