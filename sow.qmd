# Adding Integral to your scheme of work

We currently have Integral mapping for **A Level Maths only** for AQA, OCR (A and B) and Edexcel. We plan to map WJEC and Further Maths in the future.

To find the downloadable spreadsheet, head to the AS Pure section of your course.

Choose 'Introduction, overview and papers'.

Click 'Integral links for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_' as shown in this picture:

When you open the spreadsheet, you will see a tab for Pure and one for Applied. Each tab has the specification reference and then links to the relevant section of Integral.

You can then copy the links into your schemes of work so that teachers (and students) can quickly find the right place on Integral.
